                   The wheel bearings are essential in the operation of your vehicle; they allow friction-reduced movement and rotation of the hub assembly, and thereby provides smooth tyre and wheel rotation. Think for a moment what would happen if you are driving along, with your loved ones, and a wheel bearing fails. When a wheel bearing goes bad, you are in for some trouble.
